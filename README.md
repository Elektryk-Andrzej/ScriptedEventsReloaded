# Why use SER?
## ✅ Designed with SCP:SL in mind
Every aspect of SER is designed around simplifying the most widely used features of SCP:SL plugins.

## 🧠 Easy to learn
SER cuts down on the unnecessary complexity to remain simple and intuitive, while still providing all the features you need.

## 📰 Extensive documentation and examples
A core part of SER is its devotion to easy access to required documentation and examples. Check out the Wiki!

## 💰 Money saving
SER is completely free to use, why pay someone to make a simple plugin for you?

## 🗂️ All on the server
You don't need any external programs to write scripts with SER, just text files and access to your server.

## ⚡ Speed of development
As soon as you save your script, the changes are applied immediately, no server restart is required.

## 🔌 Plugin extensions
SER allows you to control other plugins (like custom roles) directly from your scripts! 

### Just Another Way to Make Plugins?
Nope. SER is not here to compete with traditional plugins.

To stay simple and approachable, SER doesn't support the more advanced features that standard plugin frameworks do.  
**Do not treat SER as an all-in-one replacement** for C# plugin development.
